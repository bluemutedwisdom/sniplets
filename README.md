# Sniplets.

Here you can find a set of small scripts / sniplets that I wrote. These script / sniplets are categorized by scripting language.

## Bash

    - download.sh : This will only show the percentage of the download.
    - spinner.sh  : This will show a spinner by long running actions.

## Python

    - portscanner.py : This is a portscanner that work with the socket module.
    - external-ip.py : This will print your external ipaddress (ipv4 or ipv6).
